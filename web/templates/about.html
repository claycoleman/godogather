            <p>Welcome to <strong>WAYD</strong>, your hub for making events happen and see what's going on around you. Never ask around again for what's happening this weekend - <strong>WAYD</strong> will take you and your social life to the next level.</p>

            <h2>So... What exactly is WAYD?</h2>
            <h4>Terrific question. WAYD (short for What Are You Doing - genius right?) is a site designed to make your life more social and your social life more simple. Everyone's been there a million times – Friday rolls around, you still don't have anything planned for the weekend, and the texts come rolling in: "Hey, what are you doing?" "What's up tonight?" "What's the plan?" Or, if you do have an idea of something you'd like to do, you begin making the calls and sending texts of your own, inviting and rescheduling and the like. There's gotta be a better way.</h4>
            <h4>WAYD aims to be the solution to this mess. Rather than asking around for what's going on, you can check your feed and see what your friends are doing on a single feed! When you have a great idea, you simply post your event – and your friends can then check your feed, and see what you're planning. Simple!</h4>

                <h4>THE WAY IT WORKS</h4>
                <p>Thanks to Twitter's public API, we can access tweet and trend information at any given time. By running a Python script 24/7, this data can be accessed and posted onto TwitterFeed all day long. That means more current info for the world and more awesomeness for you!</p>
